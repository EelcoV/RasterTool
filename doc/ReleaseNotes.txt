Beta 2.2
========
* A hint or suggested value is shown when editing the impact of a node cluster. E.g: if
  one of the nodes in that cluster scored High impact on Physical Damage, than the
  cluster containing that node should also have at least High impact.
* On the Analysis screen, the Single Failures by level are now shown in a
  histogram graph as well as numerically.
* The Help window contains an aid to determining the Frequency class of incidents.
* Keyboard shortcuts added for several interactions (see manual).
* On the standalone app, hardware acceleration is still disabled by default, but can
  now enabled by editing the preference file by hand.
  - on MacOS: Library/Application Support/Raster/prefs.json
  - on Windows: c:\Users\<yourusername>\AppData\Roaming\Raster\prefs.json
* Various other UI improvements.
* Minor fixes and improvements.

February 2018
=============
* Release as 2.1
* Notification of tool updates. Once daily, check with the risicotools.nl website
  for an update to the standalone tool.
* Fix UI difficulties when connecting nodes. It should be easier to connect nodes now.
* Enforce type-dependent limits when connecting nodes. E.g. a wired link can be
  connected to at most two other nodes ("a cable has exactly two ends").
* After importing/opening a project, a thorough check is done on its correctness.
* Minor fixes and improvements.

January 2018
============
* Release as 2.0.1.
* Fix for a condition that could lead to data loss. This would happen when adding
  a vulnerability to a node class marked as Single.

November 2017
==============
* Release as 2.0.
* Implement a major change: a standalone app for MacOS and Windows, separate
  from a server-based version. The standalone versions operate on local files,
  and do not support project sharing.
* The tree structure is now shown using lines in Common Cause Failure View.
* Made tool more robust when trying to import corrupted projects.
* Added a check whether the tool is already running in another browser tab.
* Updated About tab of help pages.
* The project name now shows in the page title.
* Bug fixes.

January 2016
=============
We now have ePub versions of the English and Dutch manuals.

July 2015
=============
* Nodes in CCF view can now be selected, and all selected nodes can be dragged and
  dropped collectively. Normal click = select/deselect. Cmd click or Ctrl click =
  add/remove that node from the current selection. Shift click = extend selection.
* In CCF view, individual nodes and selected nodes have a popup menu. Use the menu
  to create a cluster from the selection, or to move nodes between clusters.
* Clusters also have a popup menu. Use the menu to delete the cluster, or to move it.
* Clusters can be opened/closed like accordions.
* Find panel now searches and shows suffixes.

June 2015
=============
* In the Diagrams and Single Failures screens, the service tabs at the bottom can
  now be dragged into the desired order.
* The option 'Move freely' or 'Snap to grid' has been removed. Nodes now always
  line up.
* Maintain current service when reloading the page, or when updating a shared project
  when it was changed on the server.
* Fixed: issues with merging, and other small bug fixes.

May 2015
==========
* When more than one group is used (for access control), then swapping between groups
  now hides shared projects and will not give error messages.
* Connections are now deleted (nodes are disconnected) with a single click on the
  disconnect icon (the circled X). This used to require a double click.
* Fixes when simultaneously working on a project from MSIE browsers.

February 2015
=============
* Internal changes (library upgrades) and small bug fixes.

December 2014
=============
* A new analysis tool is available: Longlist.
* The popup menu on diagram nodes has a submenu especially for node classes:
  - rename all nodes in the node class collectively
  - change the suffix from 'a', 'b', 'c' to something more meaningful.

November 2014
=============
The tool is sufficiently stable and usable to drop the 'proto' name. Since proto4, the
following features were added:
* Translations were added. The language preferences of your web browser will determine
  which interface language is shown. The default is still English, and currently only
  a Dutch translation is provided.
* A quick search feature was added. This is of use mainly in large projects.
* Double-clicking a project in the Library will now activate that project.
* You can add sticky notes to diagrams.
* Duplicating a node now creates a node class, not a duplicate with a different name.
* A help button was added. This mostly shows the tables for Frequency and Impact, but
  does allow for further expansion.
* Vulnerabilities can now be reordered: drag them up and down to put them in the
  order that seems most logical to you.
* Some visual niceties and improvements.
* And many bug fixes, some of which could lead to data corruption.


Proto 4
=======
* There are now two types of node classes: plain classes and singular classes. Plain classes
  are as before: similar nodes that share a single vulnerability assessment. Singular classes
  indicate that there is one physical component that occurs in more than one service. A plain
  class can only be converted into a singular class if there is at most one node of that class
  per service. Singular classes can always be converted back into plain classes.
* All nodes in a diagram can be moved using the Shift key. Move any node while holding Shift,
  and all nodes in the diagram will move.
* It is now possible to select nodes. Simply hold the mouse button down and drag a selection
  rectangle. All nodes in the selection can be moved by dragging the selection. All nodes in
  the selection can be deleted by clicking the right mouse button.
* The project switcher has gone. The current project is now listed in the top right corner.
  Switching must be done using the Library panel.
* The library panel is rearranged. The currently active project is indicated, and the rename
  function has been taken out.
* The node menu can be invoked using the right mouse button. This is more intuitive for most
  people.
* The workspace for diagrams can now be scrolled using normal scrollbars.
* The analysis tab now features horizontal tabs, and new reports have been added.
* Added a splash screen that hides the UI until it is ready for interaction.
* When printing, the diagram view is returned to the top-left and all sigle and common cause
  failures are expanded. This does not work in all browser (not in Chrome/webkit currently).
* Vulnerabilities can be left unassessed without affecting the overall vulnerability level.
  Previously, if any vulnerability was assessed as '-', the overall vulnerability level would
  be '-'.
* Modified the instructions on removing vulnerabilities, to better avoid unwarranted removal
  of "black swan" vulnerabilities.
* Saving a project now gives a properly named file to be saved. As a result, files cannot be
  saved offline (the server is required).
* Aging on equipment is replaced by the more general 'Malfunction'.
* Projects can now be shared, and stored on the server. Major rework has been done.


Beta 3
======
Beta 3 improves the Analysis tab with Quick Wins.
A notable visible change is that Common Cause Failures are once more called Common Cause Failures.
The themes Sunny and Overcast did not fit visually with the interface, and are now removed.
Several bugs were fixed.
