Testcases for manual testing.

All tests start with a clean app. Zap the library before testing.

=======
Test 1:
=======
Create two Wireless links, give them the same name by removing the trailing "(1)".
Create two Wired links, give them the same name by removing the trailing "(1)".
Create two Equipment nodes, give them the same name by removing the trailing "(1)".
Create two Actors, give them the same name by removing the trailing "(1)".
Create two Unknown links, give them the same name by removing the trailing "(1)".

	--> for each node type a single node class should have been created, except for Actors.
	Actors should defy any attempt to given them an identical name.
	--> there should be 4 sets of single failures, each containing the default threats, except
	for Unknown links which should have the combined set.
	--> There should be the full set of Common Cause failures, each containing the two clouds plus
	two of the other components (no actors).

Reload the browser
	--> No information should be lost.
	
Create a new service, and do the same thing (single elements will suffice).
	--> Names should remain unique across services, with a single node class for all except Actors

Create a new project, and do the same thing

Reload the browser
	--> No information should be lost.
	
Export the second project, twice.
	--> No information should be lost, and the two exported files should be identical.
	
View the node report for a wireless link.
Check all connection combinations, and make sure that the node report is accurate, both for underflows
and overflows, and that the warning triangle appears and disappears as it should.
Do the same for:
- wired links,
- equipment,
- actors,
- unknown links.

Check that the node report title is updated when the node title changes.

=======
Test 2:
=======
Add two wireless nodes. 
Open the threat list from the popup menu. Change one freq, impact, remark on each.
	--> In single failures view the same changes should be visible.
Open the threat list from the popup menu. Add a threat using the "+Add threat" button
	--> Changes should be reflected in Single Failures view.
Open the threat list from the popup menu. Delete a threat
	--> Changes should be reflected in Single Failures view.
Open the threat lists in Single Failures view. Copy from one, then paste into the other node.
	--> Threat assessments should be merged, identical threats will be retain the worst value
	for frequency and impact, new threats will be added.
	Results should not change, even then clicking the Paste button multiple times.
	
Rename one node, so that the names are identical (creating a node class)

=======
Test 3:
=======
Create two services. Add a node to each (same type) and join them into a node class.
In the Single Failure view, change the threat assessment on the class in one service.
	--> The assessment in the other service should have changed accordingly.

=======
Test 4:
=======
Create a wireless node, and set some of its default threats.
Open the wireless checklist, and copy the set.
Paste the set into the node's threat list.
	--> There should be no change; all assessments should be preserved.
Open the wired link checklist, and make sure that at least one of the threats has the same name as
for wireless links.
Make sure that the assessment for that threat is completed on the wireless link.
Copy the wired checklist into the (wireless) node.
	--> There should be no change; all assessments should be preserved.
	Also, the common threat should not be duplicated.
Create an Unknown link node, and remove all its threats.
Copy the threats from the wireless link into the (empty) Unknown link.
	--> All types on the unknown link should be set to wireless.

=======
Test 5:
=======
Open wired and wireless checklists.
Create an Unknown link node, and remove all its threats.
Add a new, unique threat to the wireless list
Copy wireless threats into the node
	--> type should be set to wireless
Copy wireless threats into wired checklist
Add a new, unique threat to the wired list.
Copy wired checklist onto node
	--> all new threats should be set to wired, including the ex-wireless threats.
Remove the added threats from the wired list.
Reload the browser.
	--> All should function without errors.

=======
Test 6:
=======
Create a second service.
Switch to Single Failures view.
Switch to the second service.
Switch back to the Diagrams view.
Drag a node into the workspace.
	--> The node should be assigned to the diagram service that was visible,
	not the other service.

=======
