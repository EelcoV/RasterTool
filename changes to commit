Upgrade jsPlumb to 1.4.1.
Do not show label circles when printing single failures.
Connection handles (half circles at the top) are now enlarged on hovering.
Renamed "jsPlumbConnection" to "connection".
Add shadows to ui-dialogs.
Removed div projstatus (long unused).
Cleaned up paint styles for jsPlumb.
Changes to dragging to create connections: from dragpoint to anywhere on the target (not just the target's dragpoint at the top-center).
When overall vulnerability levels are hidden, do show them when hovering over the node, and hide them again when the mouse pointer leaves the node.
Small corrections to default threats.
Fix: only first edit of labels succeeded, subsequent edits were ignored. Missing $(this).remove(), and therefore duplicate HTML elements.
