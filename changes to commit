Fixed: removed spurious jsPlumb repaint after deleting a node (on change node type).
Fixed: Removing the first node from a 'single' component resulted in incorrect node clusters.
Fixed error when repainting while deleting a project.
Fixed: a cloud could be connected to itself.
Added test for node being connected to itself.
Fixed : duplicating a 'Single' component is an illegal operation. Make impossible and disable menu item.
Fixed: deleting the first node in a 'single' component corrupted the project (unreachable code solved).
Change: on the CCF tab: list childclusters before unclustered nodes (helps with working on long lists of nodes)
Change: a node cluster should only have a non-empty threat assessment if it has at least two child nodes. Hide threat tablerow unless >1 child.
Change: indent nodes in the lists on the CCF tab.
Fixed: list of nodes in node clusters now scrolls when dragging. The UI is not very attractive but at least functional. Without scrolling, a long list of nodes cannot be dragged into subclusters.
